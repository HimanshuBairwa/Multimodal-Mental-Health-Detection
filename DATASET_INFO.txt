DATASET INFORMATION

YOUR PROJECT NOW HAS MULTIPLE DATASETS:

1. ORIGINAL DATASET (Your Old Data)
   Location: data/generated/phq9_dataset_original.csv
   Use for: Testing with your original setup
   
2. REAL EMOTION DATASET
   Location: data/real/emotion_processed.csv
   Source: Hugging Face (dair-ai/emotion)

4. COMBINED REAL DATASET (RECOMMENDED!)

MAIN FILE:
phq9_dataset_real.csv (in root folder)
   This is your PRIMARY dataset
   Uses combined real data
   All your scripts will use this by default

TO SWITCH DATASETS:
Just copy any dataset to root folder and rename to: phq9_dataset.csv

Example:
   copy data/real/emotion_processed.csv phq9_dataset.csv

YOUR SCRIPTS THAT WORK WITH THESE:

   step1_setup_data.py - Data preprocessing
   step2_train_survey_model.py - Model training
   step3_dynamic_questions.py - Question generation
   step4_audio_models_best.py - Audio model training

ALL YOUR EXISTING SCRIPTS WORK WITH REAL DATA NOW!
